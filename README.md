# PlaceHolder Bookings Prototype System

## Things to bare in mind
+ This was tested using PHP local development server
+ There are a multitude of 'worst practice' coding errors
+ These will NOT be present in the Final Deliverable, this project acts as a proof of concept feature test, with an incredibly limited scope
+ The project IS vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting and SQL Injections, to an extent. There is partial sanitisation implemented
